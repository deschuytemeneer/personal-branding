              I'm a web developer with a knack for designing (web) things. I have over 5 years of
              experience as a front end web developer. Within those 5 years, I have occasionally
              done some design work, some UI/UX, and some back end.
            </p>
            <p>
              My philosophy regarding code is "leave it better than you find it". In this
              ever-evolving world, why leave old code stale and dusty? I'll gladly use my expertise
              to take that old, outdated code and polish it up, making it all nice and
              <strong class="--animated-gradient">shiny</strong>
              again.

              <p>
                I was hired as a front end web developer to implement a greenfield solution for an
                internal collaborative diagramming tool for JnJ. The project started out as a
                ReactJS front end with a NestJS back end running on an AWS Lambda. We chose GraphQL
                as our design of choice for our API.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a late stage of the project, we ran into performance concerns due to the
                monolithic nature of the NestJS app, so we invested in a refactoring of the whole
                back end to a more decoupled approach, over multiple Lambda's as opposed to one.
                This is to this day still one of the most ambitious yet satisfying back end projects
                I've taken on.

              <p>
                In 2023, I built a portfolio for a friend of mine, who is a composer. He had made a
                rough design with wix, which I then converted into a "proper" website. As he wanted
                to be able to add, modify and delete content at any point in the future, I decided
                on a CMS approach. Additionally, we settled for a headless CMS both liked the
                decoupling of the content from the design, which was pretty set in stone anyway.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the end, I decided on Contentful as a CMS. I built the front end using Gatsby,
                since I liked the integration it provided with Contentful. I had also recently
                learned of chakra-ui, and the "utility-based" components and well thought out
                theming system seemed like a good fit for this project.
